# NYC-Daily-inmates 

The aim of this notebook is to visualize and analyze the daily change of inmate population in New York City. The notebook will also inspect the relationship between the recorded mental health of inmates and their infraction. The purpose of this is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the mental health of inmates and the potential effects thereof (infraction) as well as how this might impact the duration of their stay and the overall population in prisons.
