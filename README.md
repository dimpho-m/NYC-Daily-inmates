# NYC-Daily-inmates-dashboard 

The aim of this dashboard is to visualize the daily change of inmate population in New York City. The dashboard will also inspect the relationship between the recorded mental health of inmates and their infraction. The purpose of this is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the mental health of inmates and the potential effects thereof (infraction) as well as how this might impact the duration of their stay and the overall population in prisons.
